# Sequences: Lists and Tuples
# These are -- surprise -- sequences of values
mylist = [1, 2, "two", False, 3.14]
# print(len(mylist))
# to access a member of a sequence type, use []
# print(mylist[1])
# print(mylist[-1])
# add a list to another list
# mylist[0] = 100
# print(mylist)
# mylist.append(200)
# print(mylist)

# another_list = [4, 5, 6]
# mylist = mylist + another_list
# print(mylist)

# mystr = "This is a string"
# print(mystr[5:7])
# use slices to get parts of a sequence
# print(mylist[1:4:2])
# print(mylist[::2])

# you can use slices to reverse a sequence
# print(mylist[::-1])


# Tuples are like lists, but they are immutable
mytuple = (1, 2, "two", False, 3.14)
print(mytuple[1])


# Sets are also sequences, but they contain unique values

# Set, however, can not be indexed like lists or tuples
# print(myset[0]) # this will cause an error

# Test for membership
